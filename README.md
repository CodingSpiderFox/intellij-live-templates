# IntelliJ Live templates

This project is a collection of IntelliJ Live templates for various Java libraries.

If not stated otherwise, the Scope of the templates are by default Java All.

## How to add them?

You can assemble the templates manually in IntelliJ's **Settings > Editor > Live Templates**.

For now there is no importable version of them, maybe in the future.

## Live template variables

If you are interested in adding extra functionality to your live templates there is a (not yet comprehensive) collection of guides about the functions that are available
for the template variables. For the guides head to the [Template variable functions](template_variable_functions/) folder.

## Contribution and support

If you find any issues in any of the templates or you have a suggestion or request, please create a GitHub issue in this project.
