# IntelliJ Live templates

This project is a collection of IntelliJ Live templates for various Java libraries.

If not stated otherwise, the Scope of the templates are by default Java All.

## How to add them?

You can assemble the templates manually in IntelliJ's **Settings > Editor > Live Templates**.

For now there is no importable version of them, maybe in the future.

## Live template variables

If you are interested in adding extra functionality to your live templates there is a (not yet comprehensive) collection of guides about the functions that are available
for the template variables. For the guides head to the [Template variable functions](template_variable_functions/) folder.

The documents in that folder summarize how functions that are available for Live Template variables work, provides examples and screenshots where feasible.

The list of functions is according to the official documentation at [https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/template-variables.html](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/template-variables.html).

The related macros can be found at
- https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-community/tree/master/platform/lang-impl/src/com/intellij/codeInsight/template/macro
- https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-community/tree/master/java/java-impl/src/com/intellij/codeInsight/template/macro

#### Notes

- Wherever the string **[empty string]** appears, consider it as a literal empty String.
- Most of the functions also include their descriptions from the official documentation.

Please note that I always try to come up with useful examples for each macro but in case I can't,
I may throw in a silly example just for the sake of demonstrating how the macro works.
