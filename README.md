# IntelliJ Live template

This project is a collection of IntelliJ Live templates for various Java libraries.

## How to add them?

You can assemble the templates manually in IntelliJ's **Settings > Editor > Live Templates**.

For now there is no importable version of them, maybe in the future.

## Contribution and support

If you find any issues in any of the templates, please create a GitHub issue in this project.
